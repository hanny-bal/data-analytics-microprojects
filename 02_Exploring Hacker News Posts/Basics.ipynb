    "# Exploring Hacker News\n",
    "In this project, we will analyze the popular tech-news-site [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "Hacker News itself is an extremely popular website in technology and startup circles where users can post stories (a.k.a. \"posts\") which are commented upon and voted. It works just like [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com) with many posts even being referenced to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our analysis, we'll use [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts) from Kaggle which contains the posts between September 2015 and 2016. Note that it has been reduced from almost 300,000 rows to approximately 20,000 rows by removing all submissions that did not receive any comments, and then randomly sampling from the remaining submissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are the descriptions of the columns:\n",
    "- 0 `id`: The unique identifier from Hacker News for the post\n",
    "- 1 `title`: The title of the post\n",
    "- 2 `url`: The URL that the posts links to, if it the post has a URL\n",
    "- 3 `num_points`: The number of points the post acquired, calculated as the total number of upvotes minus the total number of downvotes\n",
    "- 4 `num_comments`: The number of comments that were made on the post\n",
    "- 5 `author`: The username of the person who submitted the post \n",
    "- 6 `created_at`: The date and time at which the post was submitted\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Objectives\n",
    "We're specifically interested in posts whose titles begin with `Ask HN` or `Show HN`.\n",
    "- Users submit `Ask HN` posts to ask the community questions.\n",
    "- Users submit `Show HN` posts to show the community a project.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll compare these two types of posts to dermine whether `Ask HN` or `Show HN` posts receive more comments on average and if posts created at a certain time receive more comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Loading the data\n",
    "Our data is stored in `hacker_news.csv`, so let's use python to load the file and store in in a list."
